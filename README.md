## Description
### General description
A JS app that shows the level of air pollution in a chosen city or in the area next to the user.</br>
The application works in two steps:
1. Set up the research;
2. Read the results.

There are two ways to set up the research:
1. Enter in the search bar the name of a city;
2. Detect your GPS position using the proper buttom.

The output of this app is a box with all the relevant information. This box contains one main section with the most important results and two secondary sections: 
1. One with more details on the air quality and some generic information;
2. The other one with a list of the nearby survey stations.
